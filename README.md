# 👋 Hey, I'm Sravan

part builder, full-time learner. I thrive on breaking things down, then building them back better.

### 💻 What I Do

- 🛠️ Currently crafting `Time Capsule Archiver` — a C++ tool that seals your files with password or time-based locks.
- ⚙️ Skilled in C++, with working knowledge of Go and JavaScript — and a strong interest in clever systems and tool building.
- 🧩 Passionate about creative projects, automation, and making software that feels like solving a mystery.

### 📚 Always Learning About
- Low-level programming (memory, performance, internals)
- Security-minded development
- Clean, scalable system design

### 🌟 Fun Facts
- 🌙 Night owl dev — you’ll usually find me coding past midnight
- 🏃‍♂️ Athletic by habit — when I’m not solving memory bugs, I’m probably running or training
